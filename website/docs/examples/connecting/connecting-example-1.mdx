:::danger Deprecated Authentication Method
Username/password authentication is being deprecated by Snowflake. Use [External OAuth or Key Pair Authentication](/docs/authentication-and-mfa) instead.

See: [Planning for the deprecation of single-factor password sign-ins](https://docs.snowflake.com/en/user-guide/security-mfa-rollout)
:::

This example shows basic username and password authentication. If you have Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) enabled, you'll need to approve a Duo request on your device during connection.


```typescript
import { promisifyConnection } from "snowflake-promise";
import snowflake from "snowflake-sdk";

const connection = promisifyConnection(
  snowflake.createConnection({
    account: "your-account",
    username: "your-username",
    password: "your-password",
    // Optional: specify database, schema, warehouse
  })
);

try {
  await connection.connect();
  console.log("Successfully connected to Snowflake");
} catch (error) {
  console.error("Connection failed:", error.message);
  return;
}

// Now you can execute queries
// const { resultsPromise } = connection.execute({ sqlText: "SELECT 1" });
```
